# BetterRest (BetterSleep) - Project 4 (+ challenges)


From Hacking with Swift:
>The actual app we’re building is called BetterRest, and it’s designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night’s sleep by asking them three questions:
>
>- When do they want to wake up?
>- Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
>- How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?

## Challenges
From Hacking with Swift:

>1. Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!
>2. Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
>3.Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
