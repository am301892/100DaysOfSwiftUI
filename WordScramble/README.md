# WordScramble - Project 5 (+ challenges)


From Hacking with Swift:
>The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

## Challenges
From Hacking with Swift:

>1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
>2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
>3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
