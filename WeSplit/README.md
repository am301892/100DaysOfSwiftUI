## Topics

Form, NavigationStack, @State, @FocusState and more 

## Challenges
From Hacking with Swift:

>1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
>2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
>3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%.
