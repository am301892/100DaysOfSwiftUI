# Rock Paper Scissors - Milestone Projects 1-3


From Hacking with Swift:
>You have a basic understanding of arrays, state, views, images, text, and more, so let’s put them together: your challenge is to make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

>So, very roughly:
>- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
>- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
>- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
>- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
>- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
>- So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.

>- Start with an App template, then create a property to store the three possible moves: rock, paper, and scissors.
>- You’ll need to create two @State properties to store the app’s current choice and whether the player should win or lose.
>- You can use Int.random(in:) to select a random move. 
>- Create a VStack showing the player’s score, the app’s move, and whether the player should win or lose. 
>- The important part is making three buttons that respond to the player’s move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
>- Use the font() modifier to adjust the size of your text. If you’re using emoji for the three moves, they also scale.
